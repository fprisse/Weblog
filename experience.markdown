## Wind Turbine Service

Together with a leading operational consulting group we were asked to improve the performance of the service organisation of a large manufacturer of wind-turbines. The client’s had grown to be one of the largest producers of wind-turbines in less than 10 years. Part by natural growth but mostly by acquisition. The aim was to improve the uptime of the turbines in their care and improve their cost per contract. Their service organisation had undergone growth by duplication to keep up with the rapidly expanding number of turbines they were servicing in an ever expanding geographical area. We modelled their asset base and failure statistics, thus creating a model on which we could test several scenario’s in terms of driving time, spare part management, de-central warehousing, and technical competences of their staff. Together with the Service MT we chose for a model with Central Planning and Distributed responsibly for quality and performance. In a timeframe of 6 months this was implemented in the client’s organisation thereafter.

## Integration of offshore gas production

We were asked to help restructure the technical organisation of a major Gas Exploration and Production company. Already a decision had been made to integrate the technical organisation of their three operating companies around the southern north sea, up to then these where pillared country organisations. Together with the new Management Team we design, built, staffed and trained the new technical organisation.

## Uptime in Yarn factory

A performance yarn producer on the brink of doubling it's production capacity employed their own in-house operational excellence consulting outfit to help them overcome production problems beforehand. We were asked to support them in this effort. Through statistical analysis of production losses we identified room for a production increase of approximately

Here is a sample of the measures take to realise the benefits:

 * Shift reporting based on OEE (overall equipment effectiveness)
 * Improved Production and Maintenance planning
 * Reduced number of changeovers
 * A new uniform re-start process
 * Limited set of equipment settings

## Process Redesign for Carlease Company

For a major car lease company that had undergone fast growth through acquisition and mergers we cleaned up a legacy of historically developed complexity and misalignment. Together with Implementum we took a very technical approach to their order fulfilment process. With key people from the client organisation we mapped all their core processes in all it’s complexity. Next (again in client engaging workshops) we established a production industry like input-output model per business function and built lean business processes and accompanying organisational design that fitted in terms of function and capacity.
