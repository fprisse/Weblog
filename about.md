Their service organisation had undergone growth by duplication to keep up with the rapidly expanding number of turbines they were servicing in an ever expanding geographical area. We modelled their asset base and failure statistics, thus creating a model on which we could test several scenario’s in terms of driving time, spare part management, de-central warehousing, and technical competences of their staff. Together with the Service MT we chose for a model with Central Planning and Distributed responsibly for quality and performance. In a timeframe of 6 months this was implemented in the client’s organisation thereafter.
