 A focused industry perspective on AI adoption within physical asset infrastructure. After a brief introduction on the subject we'll make it real with two examples from Unihorn (a Strukton company) and Capgemini.
 Afterwards there is room for questions and discussion.

 You can expect to hear about:

 - The practicalities, lessons and pitfalls of implementation
 - How to start making AI work for you
